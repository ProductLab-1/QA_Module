## Quality Assurance Module
 Welcome to the Quality Assurance Module of ProductLab. At this point you have a general understanding of how to build a basic secure fullstack web application. So now you understand what it takes to build an application. The next step is understanding how real development teams ship code. This module and the subsequent module, DevOps, will focus on giving you a background in the processes, frameworks and systems you will likely encounter while leading a Dev team through a launch. But lets not get ahead of ourselves, today we're talking about Quality Assurance or "QA." At a high level QA ensures that any code developed works properly and matches the Acceptance Criteria you, as a PM, wrote. Understanding the QA process is vital as a Product Manager because it
 1. Lets you catch issues before they become a problem for your users
 2. Helps you, as a Product Manager, understand the risks in each release
 3. Ensures your product works reliably, securely and is stable 
 4. Helps you understand the pace of development and, if necessary, explain to stakeholders why a delay is required 

 If you take nothing else away from ProductLab, we highly encourage you to focus on this module and the next. Understanding Quality Assurance and DevOps will 100% make you a better PM and a better consultant. 

 ## Housekeeping
 Please watch this repo by selecting the "watch" button, which is directly above the bright green "Code" button. This will help us keep track of participation.

 This module has no hands-on work, its exclusively academic content! So no homework required, please just review the material below. 

 ## Assignments: Academic 

1. [An introduction to Service Level Agreements](https://www.atlassian.com/itsm/service-request-management/slas)
    * SLAs are important for QA, because they are one of the criteria code will be tested against. However, SLAs are an important concept to understand outside of QA as well. Another place they often come up is in architecture discussions. For example:
        * lets say you have a SLA that states the maximum acceptable page load time is 10ms
        * if you're considering adding an additional API call to a page, you should be thinking about your SLA. Will that additional call impact the page load time? Will it push us over 10ms in a worst case scenario? How can we design a solution to mitigate that? 
    * If you're curious for a more concrete discussion of SLAs for software development you can read [this](https://spd.tech/software-product-development/service-level-agreement/) also feel free to google other examples! But *remember* SLAs are not just used in software development they are used in a variety of industries, so if you're reading an example SLA and it doesn't seem to make sense, it might just be for a totally different industry! 

2. [Now, lets talk Test Driven Development](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/tdd-changed-my-life-5af0ce099f80) 
    * TDD is a framework for building code, which as a PM you obviously won't be doing. But understanding TDD will put you in the right mindset for how important QA is in software development!

3. [But testing can only be as good as the user stories you write!](https://medium.com/tribalscale/writing-technical-user-stories-434bf96f1dd5)
    * This article is a great intro into considerations you should be making while writing technical user stories 
    * Now dive into [this short Udemy course](https://eylearning.udemy.com/course/identify-functional-and-non-functional-requirements/)
        * This course really breaks down the importance of good user stories, how they impact development & testing, and also how to leverage AI to make your job as a PM easier!

4. [Recursion? Nobody knows what it means, but its provocative!](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-recursion-works-explained-with-flowcharts-and-a-video-de61f40cb7f9/)
    * Recursion can seems like an overwhelmingly technical concept, but this site breaks it down in a very consumable way. 
    * However, if you want to get a little more technical you can read [this article](https://medium.com/@siddharthgupta555t/finally-understanding-recursion-and-binary-search-trees-857c85e72978) 

5. [Performance Testing](https://eylearning.udemy.com/course/software-performance-testing-and-engineering/)
    * This Udemy course is a great crash course in performance testing. Its pretty comprehensive and gets technical towards the end. 
    * Just go through the first three sections (Introduction, Fundamental concepts of Performance Testing & Engineering, and Performance Testing Life Cycle) 
    * Feel free to continue to the hands on exercises with JMeter but they are not required
